        It would make sense to call this function, if you know all different variations of the firstnames and Lastnames
        for the SAME author.This way, we can retrieve all papers belonging to the author career.

        An example:
        Say, we want to retrieve all papers for the Author: DAVID ALBERTINI.

        Assuming that we know all the variations, we can achieve this in the following way.

        >>> lastnames = ['ALBERTINI', 'ALBERTIN', 'ALBERTINDF']
        >>> firstnames =['DAVID', 'DF', 'DAVID F', 'D F', 'D']

        >>> analyzer = DataAnalysisTool('/Users/aosingh/TethneDataAnalysis/Dataset/dataset.csv')

        """
        This method can be used to plot a histogram to determine the overlap between every 2 papers in the passed
        DataFrame(i.e. List of Papers)

        The method also expects the feature_name to be passed. Overlap is determined only for that specific feature.


        A simple EXAMPLE to understand the score calculation:
        Say we have 2 papers: P1 and P2. And the feature_name passed is 'author_keywords'
        The Author_keywords for P1 are A1 = ['x', 'y']
        The Author_keywords for P2 are A2 = ['x', 'y', 'z']
        Overlap Score is len(A1 intersection A2)/len(A1 union A2)
        So, overlap-score for this example becomes 2/3 = 0.67

        NOW, we repeat the entire process for every pair of paper in the input parameter papers_dataframe.
        In short, what we have is a 2-D matrix where each element (i,j) is the overlap score between the
        ith and the jth paper

        From this 2-D matrix, we take the upper triangular matrix and convert it into a simple list of non-zero values.
        With the simple list, we plot the desired histogram.
